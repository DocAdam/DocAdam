### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm Adam Pugh (he/him), content creator, editor, and fan of open source projects. 

I currently work remotely as a Documentation Engineer at Meta.

I enjoy editing and contributing to open source projects in Git.

If I've helped you out with some editing and you want to say thanks - you can send me some music from my [Amazon Wish List](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2JKR4PACHA65B?ref_=wl_share).

Check out my online shop <a href="https://vinyljunction.com" target="_blank">Vinyl Junction</a> for vintage cassettes, records, and books.
